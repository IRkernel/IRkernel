# Native R kernel for IPython

This is still experimental and unreliable. Your code should be safe,
since IPython handles saving and loading notebooks in another process, but
you'll lose all your variables if it crashes.

## Installing

  1. You'll need zmq development headers to compile rzmq, as well curl headers
    for R devtools.
      * **Ubuntu/Debian**

        ```Shell
        sudo apt-get install libzmq3-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev
        ```

      * **Homebrew**

        ```Shell
        brew install zmq
        # or upgrade
        brew update
        brew upgrade zmq
        ```
        
        Note: the `zmq.hpp` header may not exist as part of your zmq installation. In which case, you can grab it directly and place in `/usr/local/include/`:
        ```
        curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zeromq/cppzmq/master/zmq.hpp -o /usr/local/include/zmq.hpp
        ```
        

      * **MacPorts**
        * make sure an [X server is intalled](http://xquartz.macosforge.org/),
          open a terminal and do the following:

          ```
          sudo port install zmq
          ```

        * Direct the compiler to use MacPorts libraries using:

          ```
          export CPATH=/opt/local/include
          export LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/local/lib
          ```

  2. Start `R` in the same terminal, and proceed as below:

    * We need development versions of several packages from Github for now,
      due to recent fixes. First, you need to make sure you have the `devtools`
      R package available. If you don't, at the R console type:

      ```coffee
      install.packages("devtools")
      ```

    * Then, you can install the necessary development dependencies with:

      ```coffee
      # Need RCurl for install_github
      install.packages('RCurl')
      library(devtools)
      install_github('armstrtw/rzmq')
      install_github("takluyver/IRdisplay")
      install_github("takluyver/IRkernel")

      # Only if you have IPython 3 or above installed:
      IRkernel::installspec()
      ```

  3. You'll also need [IPython](http://ipython.org/). If you already have a
    Python environment set up, install IPython using your preferred tools. If
    not, installing [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) is the quickest
    way to get everything you need.

# Running the notebook

If you have IPython 3 installed, you can create a notebook and switch to
IRkernel from the dropdown menu. In IPython 2.x, you will need to start the
notebook with this command:

```Shell
ipython notebook --KernelManager.kernel_cmd="['R', '-e', 'IRkernel::main()', '--args', '{connection_file}']"
```

You can also substitute 'qtconsole' or 'console' for 'notebook' in this command.
