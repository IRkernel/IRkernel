\title{An R kernel for IPython.}
\description{
IPython's modern interfaces, including the IPython Notebook, speak a JSON+ZMQ
protocol to a 'kernel' which is responsible for executing code. This protocol
is language agnostic, so other languages can take advantage of IPython's rich
UI by implementing a kernel. This package is a kernel for the R language.
